A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by projects exclusive to that project instead of being available globally

On a Windows Machine:
Control Panel -> Programs And Features -> Turn Windows features on or off

Turn on Windows Subsystem for Linux

Install Ubuntu 20.04 from the Microsoft Store

lauch the Ubuntu Distro

Once the Ubuntu machine is ready:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

pip3 install virtualenv

mkdir virtualenvironment

sudo virtualenv virtualenvironment -python=python3

source virtualenvironment/bin/activate

note: Use the commands (which python/pip3) list in order to verify you are using a different environment

deactivate (note: to deactivate the environment)
